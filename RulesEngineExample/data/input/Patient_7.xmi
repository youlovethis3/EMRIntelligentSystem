Patient meds and allergies have been reviewed. The risks and&#10;benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient. All questions&#10;were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and proposed procedure were&#10;verified prior to the procedure in the pre-procedure area by the physician and the nurse. Mental Status&#10;Examination: normal. Airway Examination: normal oropharyngeal airway, Mallampati Class I (tonsillar pillars&#10;visualized). Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination: normal. ASA Grade&#10;Assessment: P2 A patient with mild systemic disease. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was&#10;deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use moderate&#10;sedation / analgesia (conscious sedation). Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was&#10;re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood&#10;pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure.&#10;The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure.&#10;ï¿¼After obtaining informed consent, the bronchoscope was introduced through the right nostril and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The bronchoscopy was accomplished without difficulty. The patient tolerated the&#10;ï¿¼procedure well.&#10;Findings:&#10;The nasopharynx/oropharynx appears normal. The larynx appears normal. The vocal cords move normally with phonation and breathing. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal in the right lung; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.&#10;Left Lung Abnormalities: A medium sized non-obstructing erythematous, and flat lesion was found in the left mainstem bronchus. Brushings were obtained and sent for cell count, cytology, bacterial culture, viral smears &amp; culture, and fungal and AFB analysis. An endobronchial biopsy was performed using a forceps and sent for routine cytology.&#10;Complications:&#10;No complications&#10;Impression:&#10;A lesion was found in the left mainstem bronchus. Biopsied.&#10;Recommendation:&#10;- Await test results.&#10;- Follow up in clinic in one week.&#10;ï¿¼&#10;ï¿¼ï¿¼CPT Code(s):&#10;31625, Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial or&#10;ï¿¼endobronchial biopsy(s), single or multiple sites&#10;ï¿¼31623, Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with brushing or&#10;ï¿¼protected brushings&#10;ï¿¼&#10;ICD Code(s):&#10;519.19, Other diseases of trachea and bronchus&#10;ï¿¼518.89, Other diseases of lung, not elsewhere classified"/><cas:View sofa="1" members=""/></xmi:XMI>
