Resting images were obtained. The patient was &#10;stressed. Cardiolite (sestamibi) 28.75 mCi was administered at peak stress. Stress images were then obtained. &#10;Nuclear images were obtained at rest and after stress. Comparisons of the nuclear images were made.  &#10;Findings:&#10;Stress and EKG Results  &#10;- The baseline EKG was normal. The duration of exercise was 9 minutes, 45 seconds. The maximum heart rate &#10;was 142 bpm, which is 89% of the predicted maximum heart rate. The maximum systolic blood pressure was 172 &#10;mmHg. The pressure rate product was 24,400. The number of mets achieved was 10.1. The test was stopped &#10;because of typical anginal chest pain, which was resolved in less than 30 seconds into recovery. Significant greater &#10;than 1.0 mm horizontal ST depressions in inferolateral leads were seen on EKG.Normal blood pressure response to &#10;stress. Normal heart rate response to stress.  &#10;Nuclear Image Interpretation  &#10;- Rest perfusion: The entire LV has normal perfusion at rest. Stress perfusion: There is mildly reduced perfusion in &#10;the apical anterior, mid anterior, basal anterior, mid anteroseptal, basal anteroseptal segments with stress. The &#10;remainder of the left ventricle has normal perfusion with stress.  &#10;- Wall motion: Hypokinetic basal anterior, mid anteroseptal, basal anteroseptal and mid anterior segments (ASE &#10;Score 2). The remainder of left ventricular segments are normal.  &#10;- Ejection fraction was 45%.  &#10;Complications:&#10;No complications.  &#10;Impression:&#10;Subjectively positive: the patient developed exercise induced chest pain typical of angina.  &#10;Positive for ischemia by EKG criteria.  &#10;Nuclear images are positive for ischemia.  &#10;Large, moderately reduced, reversible, basal anteroseptal perfusion defect consistent with ischemia, likely &#10;correlating with a lesion in the proximal LAD artery.  &#10;Left ventricular dysfunction. Ejection Fraction 45%. Wall motion abnormality: anteroseptal.  &#10;Post-exercise abnormality is consistent with ischemic &quot;stunned&quot; myocardium.  &#10;Above average exercise capacity for the patient's age and gender.&#10;CPT Code(s): &#10;93015, Cardiovascular stress test using maximal or submaximal treadmill or bicycle exercise, continuous &#10;electrocardiographic monitoring, and/or pharmacological stress; with physician supervision, with interpretation and &#10;report  &#10;78452, Myocardial perfusion imaging, tomographic (SPECT) (including attenuation correction, qualitative or quantitative &#10;wall motion, ejection fraction by first pass or gated technique, additional quantification, when performed); multiple &#10;studies, at rest and/or stress (exercise or pharmacologic) and/or redistribution and/or rest reinjection  &#10;ICD Code(s): &#10;413.9, OTHER AND UNSPECIFIED ANGINA PECTORIS  &#10;414.9, CHRONIC ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE, UNSPECIFIED  "/><cas:View sofa="1" members=""/></xmi:XMI>
