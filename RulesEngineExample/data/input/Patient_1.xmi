Johnson, MD (Doctor)&#10;Referring MD:&#10;David Whalen, MD&#10;Procedure: Bilateral Endoscopic Maxillary Antrostomy with Tissue Removal from the Maxillary Sinus and Bilateral Endoscopic Total Ethmoidectomies&#10;Procedure Date: 05/30/2011 10:00:00 Account #: 22233&#10;Attending MD: Patrick B. Johnson, MD&#10;Patient Profile:&#10;The patient has failed appropriate non-operative treatment. As a result, surgery is recommended. The alternatives, risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient. The patient verbalized understanding of the risks as well as the alternatives to surgery. The patient wished to proceed with operative intervention. A signed and witnessed informed consent was then placed on the chart.&#10;Pre-OP Diagnosis:&#10;Chronic maxillary sinusitis, Chronic ethmoid sinusitis, Anterior ethmoid sinus polyp, Posterior ethmoid sinus polyp&#10;Post-OP Diagnosis:&#10;Chronic maxillary sinusitis, Chronic ethmoid sinusitis, Anterior ethmoid sinus polyp, Posterior ethmoid sinus polyp&#10;Anesthesia:&#10;General endotracheal anesthesia.&#10;Findings:&#10;Large amount of thickened mucosa, large amount of purulent material and large amount of mucoid material in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.&#10;Many polyps arising from the middle meatus bilaterally.&#10;Many polyps arising from the anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.&#10;&#10;ProcedureDescription:&#10;Preoperative Medications / Therapy:&#10;-Cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol) 1 gm IV given in the pre-op area.&#10;Prep / Drape:&#10;-The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position. A roll was placed underneath the&#10;shoulders. The patient was draped in the usual sterile fashion and with the eyes left uncovered. Description of Method:&#10;-NuGauze strips saturated with 4% cocaine were placed in each nostril.&#10;-After seven minutes the packs were removed. The procedure was performed using the 0o and 30o sinus endoscopes, the Takahashi, Blakesley and back biting forceps and the microdebrider. Under endoscopic visualization, the bilateral uncinate processes and bilateral middle turbinates were injected with lidocaine 1% with epinephrine.&#10;-Starting on the right side, the middle turbinate was medialized, middle meatal polyps were removed, an incision was made over uncinate and the uncinate process was removed.&#10;-In the maxillary sinus: The maxillary ostium was identified and enlarged. The sinus was inspected with the endoscope. Pus was suctioned. Polypoid tissue, polyps and thickened mucosa were removed.&#10;-In the ethmoid area: The anterior and posterior ethmoid cells were entered and opened widely. The basal lamella was resected. A Haller's cell was opened. Polyps, polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed. -The nose was temporarily packed with NuGauze strips saturated with 0.05% oxymetazoline for hemostasis. -Attention was then turned to the left side. The middle turbinate was medialized, middle meatal polyps were removed, an incision was made over uncinate and the uncinate process was removed.&#10;-In the maxillary sinus: The maxillary ostium was identified and enlarged. The sinus was inspected with the endoscope. Pus was suctioned. Polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed.&#10;-In the ethmoid area: The anterior and posterior ethmoid cells were entered and opened widely. The basal lamella was resected. A Haller's cell was opened. Polyps, polypoid tissue and thickened mucosa were removed. -The nose was temporarily packed with NuGauze strips saturated with 0.05% oxymetazoline for hemostasis. After several minutes all packing was removed. Inspection revealed no further bleeding.&#10;Dressing:&#10;Nasal/Sinus Packing &amp; Dressing:&#10;-One laminated Merocel pack was placed in the right middle meatus. One laminated Merocel pack was placed in the left middle meatus. One cannulated Merocel pack was placed in the right nasal cavity. One cannulated Merocel pack was placed in the left nasal cavity.&#10;-A mustache dressing was applied. Post-procedure Check:&#10;-Extraocular movements were intact. The patient denied diplopia. The patient reported vision to be at baseline. Pathology/Microbiology Specimen:&#10;-Specimen from the bilateral maxillary sinuses and bilateral ethmoid sinuses was sent for permanent section. The patient tolerated the procedure well. They were extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery area in good condition. Sponge / Instrument / Needle Counts:&#10;-Final counts correct. Intraoperative I/Os:&#10;-Estimated blood loss was less than 100 mL.&#10;Complications:&#10;No immediate complications.&#10;&#10;CPT Codes:&#10;31255, 50, Nasal/sinus endoscopy, surgical; with ethmoidectomy, total (anterior and posterior)&#10;31267, 50, Nasal/sinus endoscopy, surgical, with maxillary antrostomy; with removal of tissue from maxillary sinus&#10;ICD9 Codes:&#10;473.0, Chronic maxillary sinusitis 473.2, Chronic ethmoidal sinusitis 471.8, Other polyp of sinus&#10;"/>
