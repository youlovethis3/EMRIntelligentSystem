He presented with 3 hours of unstable angina. &#10;Past Cardiac History &#10;- History of previous arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. &#10;- Previous ST elevation MI March 2006. &#10;Review of Systems &#10;- The creatinine value is 1.3 mg/dL mg/dL. &#10;Medications: &#10;Visipaque 361 mL total dose. &#10;Clopidogrel bisulphate (Plavix) 225 mg PO &#10;Promethazine (Phenergan) 12.5 mg total dose. &#10;Abciximab (Reopro) 10 mg IV bolus &#10;Abciximab (Reopro) 0.125 mcg/kg/minute, 4.5 mL/250 mL D5W x 17 mL &#10;Nitroglycerin 300 mcg IC total dose. &#10;ProcedureDescription: &#10;Approach: &#10;- Left heart catheterization via right femoral artery approach. Access method: Percutaneous needle puncture. &#10;Devices Used &#10;- Balloon catheter utilized: Manufacturer: Boston Sci Quantum Maverick RX 2.75mm x 20mm.  &#10;- Cordis Vista Brite Tip 6Fr JR 4.0 &#10;- ACS/Guidant Sport .014&quot; (190cm) Wire &#10;- Stent utilized: Boston Sci Taxus RX Stent 3.0mm x 32mm. &#10;Findings: &#10;Left Ventriculography &#10;- The overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced. Left ventricular ejection fraction is 40% by left &#10;ventriculogram. Mild hypokinesis of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. There was no transaortic gradient. &#10;Mitral valve regurgitation is not seen. &#10;Left Main Coronary Artery &#10;- There were no obstructing lesions in the left main coronary artery. Blood flow appeared normal. &#10;Left Anterior Descending Artery &#10;- There was a 95%, discrete stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery. A drug eluting, Boston Sci Taxus &#10;RX Stent 3.0mm x 32mm stent was placed in the mid left anterior descending artery and post-dilated to 3.5 mm. &#10;Post-procedure stenosis was 0%. There was no dissection and no perforation. &#10;Left Circumflex Artery &#10;- There was a 50%, diffuse stenosis in the left circumflex artery. &#10;.&#10;Right Coronary Artery &#10;- The right coronary artery is dominant to the posterior circulation. There were no obstructing lesions in the right &#10;coronary artery. Blood flow appeared normal. &#10;Complications:&#10;. There were no complications during the procedure. Procedure Date: 03/28/2011 12:00:00             MRN: 18594&#10;Impression:&#10;Severe two-vessel coronary artery disease. &#10;Severe left anterior descending coronary artery disease. There was a 95% mid left anterior descending artery &#10;stenosis. The lesion was successfully stented. &#10;Moderate left circumflex artery disease. There was a 50% left circumflex artery stenosis. Intervention not warranted. &#10;The overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced with ejection fraction of 40%. Mild hypokinesis of the &#10;anterior wall of the left ventricle. &#10;Recommendation: &#10;Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg PO daily for 1 year. &#10;Aggressive risk factor modification of tobacco abuse, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. &#10;CPT Code(s): &#10;92980, LD, Transcatheter placement of an intracoronary stent(s), percutaneous, with or without other therapeutic &#10;intervention, any method; single vessel &#10;93458, Catheter placement in coronary artery(s) for coronary angiography, including intraprocedural injection(s) for &#10;coronary angiography, imaging supervision and interpretation; with left heart catheterization including intraprocedural &#10;injection(s) for left ventriculography, when performed &#10;ICD Code(s): &#10;414.01, Coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery &#10;413.9, Other and unspecified angina pectoris "/><cas:View sofa="1" members=""/></xmi:XMI>
