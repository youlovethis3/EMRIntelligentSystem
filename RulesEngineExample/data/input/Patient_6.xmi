The patient reports greatly increasing pain over the past several weeks. In addition, the patient has associated radicular symptoms of aching, radiating to the L3 dermatome distribution and L4 dermatome distribution. She is status post posterior fusion and lumbar decompression within the past several years. Due to the nature of the patient's persistent pain, epidural steroid injection is recommended. The alternatives, benefits, and risks were discussed with the patient. The patient verbalized understanding of the risks as well as the alternatives and wished to proceed with the procedure. A signed and witnessed informed consent was placed on the chart.&#10;Pre-OP Diagnosis:&#10;Left leg pain, Left leg weakness, Left L3-4 radicular pain, Left L4-5 radicular pain, Lumbar spondylosis&#10;Post-OP Diagnosis:&#10;Left leg pain, Left leg weakness, Left L3-4 radicular pain, Left, L4-5 radicular pain, Lumbar spondylosis&#10;Anesthesia:&#10;Midazolam 2 mg IV&#10;Fentanyl 50 mcg IV&#10;ProcedureDescription:&#10;Patient Positioning:&#10;- The patient was placed in the prone position on the radiolucent operating table. Description of Method:&#10;- The lumbar area was prepped and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion. The left L3-L4 level was identified for a transforaminal epidural injection and the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue were anesthetized. A 22 gauge 3.5 inch B-bevel spinal needle was passed through the skin wheal and advanced in a ventral direction until the tip of the needle was properly placed in the left superior posterior intervertebral foramen as confirmed by AP and lateral fluoroscopic views. No blood was aspirated. There was no CSF flow. Following negative aspiration, 1 mL Isovue-M200 was injected to produce the epidurogram. There was appropriate needle placement and no intravascular or intrathecal flow. 1 mL of a 40 mg/mL solution of Kenalog and 1 mL of 1% Lidocaine was injected.&#10;- Attention was then turned to the next injection. The lumbar area was prepped and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion. The left L4-L5 level was identified for a transforaminal epidural injection and a skin wheal was made at the spinal needle entry site. A 22 gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle was passed through the skin wheal and advanced in a ventral direction until the tip of the needle was properly placed in the left superior posterior intervertebral foramen as confirmed by AP and lateral fluoroscopic views. No blood was aspirated. There was no CSF flow. Following negative aspiration 1 mL Isovue-M200 was injected to produce the epidurogram. There was appropriate needle placement and no intravascular or intrathecal flow. 1 mL of a 40 mg/mL solution of Kenalog and 1 mL of 1% Lidocaine was injected.
