Paine MD  &#10;Date of Birth: 12/19/1963      Age: 43&#10;Procedure: ERCP &#10;Indications: Abdominal pain of suspected biliary or pancreatic origin, Suspected bile duct stone(s)&#10;Providers: Thomas C. Paine, MD (Doctor), Robert J. Stiles, MD (1st Assisting Doctor)&#10;Referring MD: Tyrone X. Smith, MD&#10;Medicines: Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 micrograms IV&#10;Complications: No immediate complications and no estimated blood loss&#10;Procedure:  &#10;- Prior to the procedure, a History and Physical was performed, and patient &#10;medication allergies were reviewed. The patient is competent. The risks and &#10;benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed &#10;with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was &#10;obtained. Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the &#10;physician and the nurse in the endoscopy suite at 07:45 AM. Mental Status &#10;Examination: normal. Airway Examination: normal oropharyngeal airway and &#10;neck mobility. Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination: &#10;normal. Prophylactic Antibiotics: The patient requires prophylactic antibiotics &#10;due to a prior history of endocarditis and synthetic vascular graft less than 1 &#10;year old and for the planned performance of ERCP in obstructed bile duct. ASA &#10;Grade Assessment: II - A patient with mild systemic disease. After reviewing &#10;the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The &#10;anesthesia plan was to use moderate sedation / analgesia (conscious sedation). Immediately prior to &#10;administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, &#10;respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care &#10;were monitored throughout the procedure. The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the &#10;procedure. After obtaining informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. The duodenoscope was &#10;introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the duodenum and used to inject contrast into the bile duct. The &#10;ERCP was somewhat difficult due to challenging cannulation because of peridiverticular papilla. The patient &#10;tolerated the procedure well. &#10;The Biliary Tree &#10;The scout film was normal. The esophagus was successfully intubated under direct vision. The scope was &#10;advanced to a normal major papilla in the descending duodenum without detailed examination of the pharynx, &#10;larynx and associated structures, and upper GI tract. The upper GI tract was grossly normal. The bile duct was &#10;deeply cannulated with the short-nosed traction sphincterotome. Contrast was injected. I personally interpreted &#10;the bile duct images. There was brisk flow of contrast through the ducts. Image quality was adequate. Contrast &#10;extended to the cystic duct. Opacification of the entire biliary tree was successful. The lower third of the main &#10;bile duct contained multiple stones, the largest of which was 6 mm in diameter. The lower third of the main bile &#10;duct was diffusely dilated. The largest diameter was 12 mm. A cholecystectomy had been performed. A straight &#10;Roadrunner wire was passed into the biliary tree. A 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was made with a &#10;monofilament short-tip traction sphincterotome using ERBE electrocautery. There was no post-sphincterotomy &#10;bleeding. The biliary tree was swept with a balloon starting at the bifurcation. All stones were removed and no &#10;stones were left.

Paine MD  &#10;Date of Birth: 12/19/1963      Age: 43 &#10;Impression: &#10;- Choledocholithiasis with an obstruction was found. Complete removal was accomplished by biliary&#10;sphincterotomy and balloon extraction.&#10;Recommendation: &#10;- Return patient to hospital ward for ongoing care. &#10;- NPO today. &#10;- Check amylase in the morning. &#10;- Watch for pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis. &#10;- The findings and recommendations were discussed with the referring physician. &#10;CPT Code(s): &#10;43264, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); with endoscopic retrograde removal of &#10;calculus/calculi from biliary and/or pancreatic ducts &#10;43262, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); with sphincterotomy/papillotomy &#10;74328, 26, Endoscopic catheterization of the biliary ductal system, radiological supervision and interpretation &#10;ICD Code(s): &#10;574.51, Calculus of bile duct without mention of cholecystitis, with obstruction &#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members=""/></xmi:XMI>
