White &#10;Procedure:  Colonoscopy &#10;Indications:  Hematochezia, Personal history of colonic polyps &#10;Providers:  John H. White MD, Kevin P. Taylor MD (Fellow) &#10;Referring MD:  William Jones, MD &#10;Medications:  Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 mcg IV &#10;ProcedureDescription:  &#10;Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by physician and the nurse in the  &#10;pre-procedure area. A History and Physical has been performed, and patient medication allergies &#10;have been reviewed. The patient's tolerance of previous anesthesia has been reviewed. The risks and  &#10;benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient. All  &#10;questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Mental Status Examination:  &#10;alert and oriented. Airway Examination: normal oropharyngeal airway and neck mobility.  &#10;Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination:RRR, no murmurs, no S3 or&#10;S4. ASA Grade Assessment: P1 A normal healthy patient. After reviewing the risks and  &#10;benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The anesthesia plan  &#10;was to use moderate sedation/analgesia (conscious sedation). Immediately prior to administration of medications, the &#10;patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood &#10;pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure. The &#10;physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure. After I obtained informed consent, the scope was &#10;passed under direct vision.  &#10;Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. &#10;The colonoscope was introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice &amp; IC &#10;valve. The quality of the prep was good. The patient tolerated the procedure well.&#10;Findings:&#10;A benign appearing sessile, non-bleeding polyp was found in the rectum. The polyp was 5 mm in size. The polyp was &#10;removed with a saline injection-lift technique using the cold snare. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated &#10;blood loss was minimal. &#10;A pedunculated, non-bleeding polyp was found in the sigmoid colon. The polyp was 7 mm in size. The polyp was &#10;removed with a hot forceps. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal. &#10;Multiple large-mouthed diverticula were found in the descending colon. &#10;Non-bleeding prolapsed internal hemorrhoids were found on retroflexion and were Grade II (internal hemorrhoids that &#10;prolapse but reduce spontaneously). &#10;         &#10;Impression:&#10;- One 5 mm benign appearing polyp in the rectum. Resected and retrieved. &#10;- One 7 mm polyp in the sigmoid colon. Resected and retrieved. &#10;- Diverticulosis of the descending colon. &#10;- Internal hemorrhoids were found. &#10;Recommendation:   &#10;- High fiber diet.  &#10;- Await pathology results.  &#10;- Repeat colonoscopy for surveillance in 3 years. &#10;- The findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient.&#10;CPT Code(s):  &#10;45385, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by snare&#10; technique &#10;45384, 59, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by hot &#10;biopsy forceps or bipolar cautery &#10;45381, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with directed submucosal injection(s), any substance &#10;ICD Code(s): &#10;211.4, Benign neoplasm of rectum and anal canal &#10;211.3, Benign neoplasm of colon  &#10;562.10, Diverticulosis of colon (without mention of hemorrhage)   &#10;455.2, Internal hemorrhoids with other complication  &#10;578.1, Blood in stool &#10;V12.72, Personal history of colonic polyps  "/><cas:View sofa="1" members=""/></xmi:XMI>
